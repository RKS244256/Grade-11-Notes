"II disapprove of what you say, but I defend to the death your right to say it" - Voltaire

*What it means:* It's difficult to defend one's right to free speech if their opinions are deemed tasteless. However, the right to expression means nothing if we don't defend that right regardless.

Under s. 2(b) of the Charter, you are free to think and believe what you want and publicly express your opinions through writing, art, speech, etc.

"Freedom of expression has always been regarded as one of the key freedoms in a democracy, one that the Court has been reluctant to restrict except in the clearest of circumstances."

Freedom of the press and other media is included in s. 2(b) as media are seen as the means for cumminicating information to the public and as a forum for speaking our minds. **There is no such  thing as a democracy without free press**.

## Landmark Cases

### Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec

A landmark case in the freedom of expression.

This case issue was the Consumer Protection Act of Quebec place a limitation on advertising at children under the age of 13.

Companies, organizations and other similar entities generally have rights and freedoms.

In considering this case, the SCC declared that "all activities conveying/attempting to convey meaning are expression for the purposes of s. 2(b) and such are protected by the Charter." Nevertheless, the Court ruled that the Act did not infringe unreasonably on Irwin Toy's right to freedom of expression.

The definition of "expression" outlined in IT Ltd. v. Quebec has been cited in many s. 2(b) cases, more notably those involving hate & obscenity issues.

### R. v. Zundel

- Charged with disseminating misinformation (holocaust-denial)
- Zundel argued his freedom of expression was being infringed

In this case, the Court said all comm. that conveys meaning or attempts to convey meaning is protected under s. 2(b). The content of the comm. was irrelevant. S. 2(b) is fundamental because its purpose is to permit free expression.

The protection of this free expression extends to include minority views which the majority regards are wrong/false/offensive

The court is concerned that overbroad laws that restrict freedom of expression will have a "chilling effect" on free speech. Therefore, freedom of expression has been widely and broadly interpreted by the courts.

We do not have the right not to be offended.

### R. v. Sharpe

S. 2(b) has also been used in challenges involving CSAM charges.

The sick fuck known as Sharpe was faced with CSAM  charges under s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. He challenged the constitutionality of the provision in the criminal code.

Sharpe claimed it violated his freedom of expression. The court found that the provision did violate his rights however it was justified under s. 1.

The CSAM in question was essentially lolicon and were drawn by Sharpe (degenerate).

The court said "freedom of expression makes possible our liberty"

### Ward v. Quebec
