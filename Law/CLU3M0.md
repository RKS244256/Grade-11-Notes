# Introduction To Law

## What Are Laws?

Laws are a reflection of the values and beliefs of a society. As such, when society changes, so do laws. Developments in technology are also a notable factor when it comes to changing laws.

### Criteria

1. Laws are a set of rules established an enforced by the government.
2. Laws are mandatory.
3. Laws have a detailed set of consequences.

### Laws vs. Rules

Laws, when broken often have more severe consequences than rules. Laws are often enforced by the government as opposed to rules which are often not.

## Why Do We Have Laws

Societies need laws to limit the behavior of it's citizens. Laws are designed to protect citizens from harm and implement systems to settle disputes. In order for laws to have any effect, they are enforced by the government and carry penalties and consequences.

### 5 Functions Of Law

1. **Establish rules of conduct**: Laws layout guidelines for individuals in society to reduce conflicts. *Example*: Traffic laws help us avoid chaotic roads and accidents
2. **Provide a system of enforcement**: For laws to have any purpose and meaning, they need to be enforced. *Example*: Police officers
3. **Protect Rights & Freedoms**: Laws should protect our rights and freedoms. They can encourage values of respect & tolerance. *Examples*: Charter of Rights & Freedoms
4. **Protect Society**: Criminal law is designed to protect people from harm. Society decides ethics and what is considered wrong and sets consequences for those who violate said ethics. *Example*: Criminal law, Firearm laws
5. **Resolve Disputes**: An important function of law is to resolve disputes & settles conflicts. This can be achieved via negotiations or in court. Laws create systems that ensure disagreements can be resolved fairly. *Example*: Trespass
## Rule Of Law

### Definition

The idea that in order for the law to function smoothly and fairly, all members agree to abide by the law. Without rule of law, powerful individuals could take advantage of the people using abuses of power in order to force demands upon them.

### 3 Aspects

#### Law is necessary to keep peaceful order

Laws wouldn't be needed if we, as humans did not interact. Unfortunately, we do talk to each other and therefore, need laws to minimize and resolve conflict. With a clear system of rules, how they will be treated, how to treat others, and what's expected of them. The rule of law ensures there's a legal response to actions deemed unjust.
#### Law applies to everyone equally

The applies **equally** to everyone no matter their circumstances. Whether you're the king or homeless, the law applies equally.
#### No one can have unrestricted power to limit rights unless authorized by law

The law gives individuals power and only the power prescribed by law. Because the law is created by elected officials, ideally, citizens control which laws are passed by voting for said officials.


### Canadian Constitution

The Canadian Constitution is the primary law which grants the power to govern. This is the supreme law in Canada. Rule of law is recognized in the *Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms* which is under the Constitution Act, 1982.

Laws cannot violate the constitution otherwise, it may be read or struck down.
### Magna Carta

800 year old document. Means "the great charter". Written in response to King John by barons who were taken from in June 1215. Decreed that everyone was under the rule of law including monarchs. Only originally applied to free men. Inspires many constitutions and charters of rights and freedoms. Grants equal rights to all citizens and people. Many political movements were inspired by Magna Carta.
### Mechanisms To Uphold The Rule Of Law
#### Separation Of Powers

In order to support the principle of equal application of the law, Canadian law works according to separation of state powers. 

This ensures fairness and equal accountability by making it so legislators are not judges and also lawyers (those making the laws also judging and interpreting them then representing individuals in a court of law.)

Rule of law requires that lawyers and judges operate free of external interference and without bias. 

This requires judicial independence, impartiality, and accountability.
##### Judicial Independence

Judges should be able to hear legal cases without external influence. 

There's an emphasis on influence from politicians as it can lead to the interests of the state violating the rights of private individuals.

The state cannot influence the courts nor punish judges for nonoptimal rulings.

##### Judicial Impartiality

*The Canadian Constitution* ensures Canadians are granted a fair trial and can be heard during legal conflicts. 

Judges should ensure that they can perform their jobs as unbiased decision makers. 

Should a judge stand to benefit from a ruling or cannot reasonably suspend their personal feelings or attitudes, they should exclude themselves from particular cases.
##### Judicial Accountability

Judges are accountable for their rulings and that any ruling (aside from rulings from the *Supreme Court of Canada*) can be reviewed and appealed.
##### Lawyer Independence

Lawyers should represent the interests of their clients without any internal or external interference.

A lawyer should ensure their client's case is heard and that their interests are addressed (granted it's performed within the confines of the law.) For example, they cannot hide evidence that proves their client is guilty.
#### Laws

Laws are created in order to establish what people can and cannot do.

They can also set out basic procedures for the government and establish rights for individuals within Canada.

Law is not a static, unchanging thing. In Canada, the 2 main ways law can change is when judges interpret the law and set precedent or laws changed/debated by politicians. That kind of law is called statue law.

#### Police

Police and other types of law enforcement enforce laws within Canada. They investigate crime and charge those who break the law.

Their powers are set out by law and and they must balance the need for enforcement and the protection of the privacy of individuals. 

Individuals are **innocent until proven guilty.**

Ideally, there are effective mechanisms and agencies to keep police in check by allowing individuals to make public complaints about police activities.
#### Courts

Courts hold people accountable for their actions, hear cases when the law may be broken, and create new common law via precedent.

Courts interpret laws and review laws which may violate the constitution.

Courts can be distinguished according the types of cases heard. (Criminal, civil, military, appeals, etc.)

Courts of appeal exist so court rulings can be reviewed and corrected if they are thought to be unfair or incorrect.
#### Sanctions

Sanctions are penalties received due to breaking a law, legal agreement, or regulations. 

Sanctions give a reason for people to follow the rules and laws.

They do this in few ways:
- Retribution: revenge against an individual who broke the law
- Removal: separating potentially harmful people from society
- Restitution: Returning/repairing things to their original condition before the offence.
- Restoration: Ensuring the victim is emotionally whole and can return to society.
- Rehabilitation: Teaching offenders new skills and attitudes to reintegrate them back into society
- Reinforcement: Setting examples for the public to establish actions have consequences.

Sanctions can be minor or major penalties depending on the law broken.

#### Administrative Review
Some disputes are settled outside of courts and these are delegated to other bodies who can make decisions based on evidence. Examples include the Landlord-Tenant board.
